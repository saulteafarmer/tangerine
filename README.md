## 🌟 Key Features

### 🛡️ PvE Focus
- **Roam Freely**: Gather resources and explore the map without constant PvP threats. PvP zones are restricted to monuments, where higher-end rewards await.
- **Raid Restriction**: Player bases are protected from other player damage once upgraded to Wood or higher. Raid Protection will end after the last weekend of the wipe.

### 🛠️ Bitcoin Mining
- **Generate Hash**: Deploy your own Bitcoin mining rig and upgrade your PSU and hashboards to generate hash. Maximize your in-game earnings!
- **Redeem Your Hash**: Visit the community center at Outpost or Bandit Camp turn your mined hash in to be counted
- **Real Bitcoin Rewards**: Players compete to earn each block's reward. Each SteamID's share of the total hash turned in determines the Blood they can claim in the next block.

### 🩸 Blood = Satoshis

Blood is the primary asset on Tangerine and acts as a transferable in-game currency tied to Bitcoin. Players can use it to claim Bitcoin rewards or convert it back into sats.
  - **/claim**: Use this command to claim any earned blood from prior blocks.
  - **/buyblood**: Purchase blood with Bitcoin through this command to fuel your in-game economy.
  - **/sendblood**: Convert blood back to Bitcoin by trading it with `/sendblood`, which transfers blood to sats directly.

### 🏆 Competitive Events
- **Sputnik**: Timed events where players compete against attack choppers, NPCs and each other to gather resources from fallen space fragments. Completing Sputnik can reward up to a full day’s worth of mining resources.
- **Convoy Reforged**: A traveling convoy arrives to turn in their hash and purchase resources for their miners. Convoys come in different levels, with some lightly guarded and others more heavily protected than a fallen Sputnik.
